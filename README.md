- **Employee Management**:
  - Add Full-Time and Part-Time Employees.
  - List Full-Time and Part-Time Employees.
  - Delete and Update Employee Records.
  - Search for Employees by Code.
  - Generate and Print Employee Pay Slips.
- **File Handling**:
  - Save and Load employee records to and from binary files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need:

- A C++ compiler (GCC).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PayrollManagementSystem.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd PayrollManagementSystem
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**

   Use your C++ compiler to compile the `main.cpp` file along with the necessary header files.

   For example, using `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ -o PayrollManagementSystem main.cpp FullTimeEmployee.cpp PartTimeEmployee.cpp PayrollSystem.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Execute the compiled binary:

   ```bash
